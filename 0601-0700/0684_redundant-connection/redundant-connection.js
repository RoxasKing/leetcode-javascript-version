/*
  In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

  The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

  The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

  Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

  Example 1:
    Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
    Output: [2,3]
    Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
      1
     / \
    2 - 3

  Example 2:
    Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
    Output: [1,4]
    Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
    5 - 1 - 2
        |   |
      4 - 3

  Note:
    The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
    Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

  Update (2017-09-26):
  We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an undirected graph. For the directed graph follow up please see Redundant Connection II). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
